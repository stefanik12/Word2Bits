1. evaluate word2vec vectors on the same evaluation platform as quantized vectors
2. find patterns in data - can some parts of the vectors be interpreted semantically?
2.1: find data with semantic relations - e.g. objects of the same category
2.2: inside the same category, find the correlations on specific coordinates, supposedly distinct from other categories.
